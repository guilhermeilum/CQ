<h2 align="left"> Context </h2>
<blockquote> 
<p align="justify"> Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening! :space_invader: </p>
<p align="justify"> We are Guilherme Gurian Dariani and <a href="https://linktr.ee/gustavovercosa">Gustavo Duarte Verçosa</a>, undergraduate students in Science and Technology at <a href="https://ilum.cnpem.br/">Ilum School of Science</a>, a college of the <a href="https://cnpem.br/">Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM)</a>. Within the challenging curriculum, we have subjects related to Material Science every semester. This repository was created as part of the <strong>Chemical Kinetics</strong> course and will be constantly updated until the fourth semester concludes.</p>

<h2 align="left"> Quick explanation </h2>
<blockquote> 
<p align="justify"> Why <strong>Chemical Kinetics</strong>? Considering the physical-chemical aspects, Professor <a href="https://github.com/amaurijp">Amauri Jardim de Paula</a> decided to conduct a computational study to analyze models of chemical reactions, primarily focusing on gases.</p>
<p align="justify"> The main focus of the course will be a computational simulation that should be divided into three phases, as outlined in the problem presentation document. After completing each of these stages, student groups should submit the developed code in the Jupyter Lab environment, in .ipynb format, which should contain detailed descriptions of the models, theoretical considerations, calculations, and other relevant information.</p>
<p align="justify"> Throughout the work with the proposed problem, it is expected that students will acquire competencies such as the ability to identify variables and processes related to chemical reaction systems, as well as the ability to organize and structure solutions to the challenges presented. Furthermore, it is expected that they understand the underlying physico-chemical concepts of the problem and be able to analyze, interpret, and discuss the obtained results, preparing high-quality scientific reports.</p>

<h2 align="left"> What do we have here? </h2>
<blockquote> 
<p align="justify"> In this repository, we have two <i>branches</i>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p align="justify">dev: it is the branch where developers work on their individual tasks; it can be unstable and contain code in development, so it is not recommended for production deployment. </p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">main: it is the main and stable branch of the project; it is considered ready for production deployment.</p></li>
</ul>
